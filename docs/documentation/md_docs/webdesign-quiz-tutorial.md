## Technical Implementation

### âœ… **Web Design Tutorial Configuration**
Located in `src/components/TutorialConfig.js`:

```javascript
export const WEB_DESIGN_TUTORIAL_STEPS = {
    firstTime: [...], // 8 steps
    combo: [...],     // 2 steps
    lowHealth: [...], // 2 steps
    victory: [...]    // 2 steps
};

export const WEB_DESIGN_TUTORIAL_TRIGGERS = {
    firstTime: (scene) => { /* Web Design specific logic */ },
    combo: (scene) => { /* Web Design specific logic */ },
    lowHealth: (scene) => { /* Web Design specific logic */ },
    victory: (scene) => { /* Web Design specific logic */ }
};
```

### âœ… **Scene Integration**
Updated `src/scenes/quizscenes/WebDesignQuizScene.js`:

- **Tutorial Manager Integration**: Inherits from BaseQuizScene but adds Web Design specific tutorial handling
- **Override Methods**: Overrides `checkAndShowTutorial()` to check Web Design specific triggers first
- **Local Storage Tracking**: Uses Web Design specific localStorage keys for tutorial completion tracking
- **Fallback Support**: Falls back to base tutorial system if Web Design specific tutorials aren't triggered

### âœ… **Smart Element Targeting**
The tutorial system intelligently targets UI elements based on content keywords:

- **"coding energy"** â†’ Player health UI
- **"Enemy Web Bug"** â†’ Enemy health UI  
- **"Development Timer"** â†’ Timer UI
- **"Code Combo"** â†’ Combo meter UI
- **"Web Development Questions"** â†’ Question area
- **"Code Answer"** â†’ Answer options

### âœ… **Tutorial Flow Integration**
Enhanced `prepareTutorialSteps()` function to handle Web Design tutorials:

```javascript
const isWebDesignTutorial = scene.topic === 'webdesign' || scene.courseTopic === 'Web Design';
let tutorialSource = isWebDesignTutorial ? WEB_DESIGN_TUTORIAL_STEPS : QUIZ_TUTORIAL_STEPS;
```

## Tutorial Content Examples
