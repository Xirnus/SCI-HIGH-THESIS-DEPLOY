# Library Scene Improvements

## Overview
The library scene has been completely redesigned from the ground up to use a modern carousel interface for better user experience and ebook accessibility.

## Key Features

### 1. Carousel Navigation
- **Topic-based Categories**: Books are organized by topics (Programming, Data Science, Web Development, etc.)
- **Visual Icons**: Each topic has a distinctive emoji icon for easy identification
- **Smooth Transitions**: Uses the existing carousel UI component for consistent navigation

### 2. Ebook Dialog System
- **Category Selection**: When a topic is selected, a dialog shows all available ebooks in that category
- **Book Information**: Each book displays:
  - Title and author
  - Status (Available, Reading, Completed)
  - Direct link to external ebook if available
- **Interactive Links**: Books with links show a "READ" button that opens the ebook in a new tab

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Modern Styling**: Clean, modern interface with proper depth and shadows
- **Status Tracking**: Books can be marked as reading/completed
- **Smooth Animations**: Polished entrance/exit animations for dialogs

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `baseLibraryScene.js` - Complete rewrite using carousel interface
- Integrates with existing `carouselUI.js` component
- Uses existing `books.json` data structure

### New Methods
- `createTopicIcons()` - Programmatically generates topic icons
- `createTopicCarousel()` - Sets up the carousel with book categories
- `showEbookDialog()` - Displays book list for selected topic
- `createBooksList()` - Renders individual books with links
- `openEbook()` - Handles external ebook link opening
- `closeEbookDialog()` - Manages dialog cleanup

### Data Structure
The scene expects `books.json` to have the following structure:
```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Programming",
      "books": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "Book Title",
          "author": "Author Name", 
          "status": "available",
          "description": "Book description",
          "link": "https://external-ebook-link.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the library scene
2. Use carousel navigation (arrows, keyboard, or click) to browse topics
3. Click on a topic to view available ebooks
4. Click "READ" button to open external ebook links
5. Use the close button or click outside to exit dialogs

## Benefits
- **Better Organization**: Topics are clearly separated and easy to browse
- **Direct Access**: External ebook links provide immediate access to resources
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new topics and books
- **Consistent**: Uses existing UI components for familiar user experience
- **Modern**: Clean, professional appearance matching the overall game design
